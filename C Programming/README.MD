# C Programming Lab Reports

This folder contains documentation of labs focused on C programming concepts, including data structures, mathematical computations, and algorithm implementations. These labs explore linked lists, tree structures, and complex calculations, highlighting both theoretical and practical applications of C programming.

## Lab Summaries

### 1. Linked Lists and Structures
This lab explores the creation and manipulation of **linked lists** using C. It involves functions for adding, removing, and searching nodes within a list. The lab also includes implementing **stacks and queues** with linked lists, providing examples of common operations such as enqueue, dequeue, push, and pop. The focus is on structuring data with **student records**, each containing names, IDs, and ages.

Key Concepts:
- Creating and managing linked lists
- Stack and queue operations
- Using structures to store complex data

### 2. Tree Introduction
This lab introduces **binary trees** and demonstrates their implementation using C. It covers fundamental tree operations, such as adding and deleting nodes, and supports **in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals**. The lab also explores how binary trees can efficiently store and search data.

Key Concepts:
- Binary tree creation and management
- Tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, post-order)
- Node insertion and deletion

### 3. Volume Calculations and Mathematical Algorithms
This lab involves a **menu-driven program** that allows users to perform a variety of mathematical operations. The program can calculate the **volume and cost of filling a pool or hot tub**, compute the **factorial** of a number, solve the **Tower of Hanoi problem**, and generate **Fibonacci sequences**. All operations are implemented in C with recursive and iterative approaches.

Key Concepts:
- Mathematical operations in C (volume, factorial, Fibonacci)
- Recursive solutions (Tower of Hanoi)
- Menu-driven user interface

## Key Takeaways
These labs provide hands-on experience with:
- **Data structures** such as linked lists and trees
- **Recursive algorithms** for solving mathematical problems
- **Practical programming techniques** using menus and user input handling
- **Memory management** with dynamic allocation

Each lab offers step-by-step implementation details and emphasizes building efficient, maintainable code. The experience gained from these labs is applicable to both systems programming and software development.
