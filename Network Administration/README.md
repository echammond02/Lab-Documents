# Network Administration Lab Reports

This folder contains documentation for labs focused on the setup, configuration, and management of enterprise networks. The labs involve deploying virtual infrastructure, configuring DNS, firewall rules, network services, and ensuring secure communication across multiple zones. 

## Lab Summary

### 1. Network Infrastructure Setup and Configuration
This lab centers around designing and deploying a complete network architecture for a fictional company, ACME, across multiple zones (HQ, Remote, DMZ). The network setup is aimed at bringing critical network services in-house and reducing costs. Key activities include:
- **Firewall and Routing Configuration**: Using pfSense to route traffic and filter packets across zones.
- **DNS Configuration**: Implementing DNS with BIND and Microsoft DNS for domain management.
- **Virtual Machines Deployment**: Setting up Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD VMs across multiple sites.
- **Load Balancing and Proxying**: Using Squid and F5 LTM for traffic management and failover.

### 2. Network Services Configuration
The lab also covers the implementation of essential network services to support the infrastructure. Key components include:
- **Email Services**: Deploying Postfix as a mail relay and Microsoft Exchange for internal email management.
- **Web Services**: Hosting websites with Apache, configured for secure HTTPS connections.
- **Active Directory**: Establishing authentication with domain controllers across the network.
- **Distributed File System (DFS)**: Configuring DFS shares to manage resources across remote sites.

### 3. Problem Solving and Recommendations
Throughout the lab, troubleshooting exercises were performed to resolve issues related to DNS misconfigurations, spam filtering, and network connectivity. Solutions included adjusting firewall rules, correcting configuration file typos, and reconfiguring DNS zones. Recommendations for future improvements are also provided, such as using Firefox for smoother configuration workflows.

## Key Takeaways
- **Comprehensive Network Management**: Hands-on experience with configuring DNS, firewalls, email, and web services.
- **Multi-Zone Network Architecture**: Implementing secure zones with HQ, DMZ, and remote connections.
- **Traffic Management**: Load balancing and proxying with Squid and F5 LTM for optimized performance.
- **Problem Solving and Troubleshooting**: Identifying and resolving network issues through methodical troubleshooting.

These labs provide a thorough understanding of enterprise network administration, emphasizing both technical setup and effective problem-solving strategies.
