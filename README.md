# Cybersecurity and Network Engineering Labs

Welcome to the **Cybersecurity and Network Engineering Lab** repository. This repository serves as a collection of documents, code, and configurations that highlight takeaways from my Purdue University labs in network engineering, systems administration, cybersecurity, and penetration testing. Each folder corresponds to a specific series of labs with all configurations and documentation included.

## Folder Descriptions

### Network Security & Firewalls
The Network Security & Firewalls folder contains labs focused on securing network environments. Topics include configuring firewalls, implementing IDS/IPS systems, and managing client-access and site-to-site VPNs for secure remote access.

### Wireless Networking & Security
Labs in this folder document the configuration and security of wireless networks using Cisco and Ubiquiti equipment. Topics include setting up secure wireless environments, auditing wireless networks for vulnerabilities, and implementing security protocols like WPA2 Enterprise via RADIUS.

### Advanced Routing
This folder documents labs focused on Cisco routing protocols and advanced networking techniques. Labs include real-world applications of OSPF, BGP, and EIGRP configurations, along with route optimization and troubleshooting exercises.

### Network Administration
This section documents hands-on labs related to administering enterprise-level networks. Labs cover network configurations of firewalls, mail servers, DNS servers, web proxies, and load balancers.

### Linux Administration
Labs in this folder document tasks related to Linux system administration. Topics include user management, system services, package management, security management, and Bash scripting for tool automation techniques.

### Incident Response Management
This folder includes lab documentation on developing and executing incident response strategies. Labs focus on identifying incidents, executing response playbooks, and using tools to mitigate and recover from security breaches.

### Intro Network Engineering
The Intro Network Engineering folder contains labs that introduce fundamental networking concepts with Cisco and HP equipment. Labs cover topics such as subnetting, basic routing and switching, and the configuration of small-scale networks with MSTP and RIPv2.

### C Programming
The C Programming folder contains labs on basic and advanced C programming. These labs explore functions, pointers, and trees used to make optimization tools.

### Digital Forensics
In this section, you will find documentation of labs involving digital forensic investigations. Labs cover the use of tools such as Autopsy, FTK, and WinHex, and focus on file system analysis, data recovery, and the investigation of compromised systems.

### Penetration Testing
Labs in this folder explore offensive security techniques and ethical hacking. Topics include vulnerability assessments, exploitation, post-exploitation activities, and the use of tools like Metasploit and Nmap.

### SAN Administration
This section includes lab documentation on managing Storage Area Networks (SANs). Labs cover iSCSI, TrueNAS, PXE booting, and SAN performance tuning to ensure efficient storage management and data availability.
