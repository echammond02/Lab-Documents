# Advanced Routing Lab Reports

This folder contains documentation for labs conducted on advanced routing protocols and network configurations. The labs explore various routing techniques, including OSPF, EIGRP, RIP, and the use of redundancy protocols like HSRP, VRRP, and GLBP. Additionally, network services like SNMP and TFTP are configured for monitoring and backup purposes.

## Lab Summaries

### 1. OSPF, GLBP, and SNMP
This lab focuses on configuring **OSPF** (Open Shortest Path First), a link-state routing protocol, alongside **GLBP** (Gateway Load Balancing Protocol) for layer 3 redundancy. Additionally, **SNMP** (Simple Network Management Protocol) is implemented for network monitoring using **LibreNMS**. Key tasks include router and switch configuration, VLAN setup, OSPF and EIGRP redistribution, and DHCP server configuration.

### 2. RIP & TFTP Backups
This lab covers the configuration of **RIP** (Routing Information Protocol) for dynamic routing between network devices. Additionally, a **TFTP** (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) server is set up to handle automated configuration backups for the routers and switches. The lab emphasizes setting up basic device configurations, creating virtual machines for the TFTP server, and utilizing **Wireshark** to capture and analyze network traffic.

### 3. EIGRP, HSRP, and VRRP
In this lab, **EIGRP** (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) is implemented to handle routing between devices, while **HSRP** (Hot Standby Router Protocol) and **VRRP** (Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol) provide layer 3 redundancy for the network. The lab explores advanced techniques such as link aggregation using **LACP** (Link Aggregation Control Protocol), as well as IPv6 configuration and routing.

## Key Concepts
