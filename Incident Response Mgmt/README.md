# Incident Response Management Lab Reports

This folder contains documentation of hands-on labs focused on developing and implementing incident response strategies. The labs explore key elements of detecting, containing, and recovering from cybersecurity incidents, with a focus on both practical investigation methods and strategic planning.

## Lab Summaries

### 1. Incident Response Lab
This lab provides a comprehensive investigation of a multi-system environment comprising Ubuntu, Debian, and Windows servers. The goal is to detect potential intrusions, classify evidence, and respond to incidents effectively.

Key Activities:
- Identifying benign, suspicious, and confirmed evidence across different operating systems.
- Investigating unauthorized SSH access and modifications of critical system files.
- Using tools like `tcpdump`, `auth.log`, and system commands to gather evidence.
- Crafting recommendations for future incident prevention, including SSH hardening and auditing improvements.

### 2. Final Computer Incident Response Plan (CIRP)
This document outlines a complete **Computer Incident Response Plan (CIRP)** for managing and mitigating security incidents. It provides a structured approach to incident handling, including roles, responsibilities, and communication strategies.

Main Components:
- **Governance and Threat Profile**: Prioritizing critical assets and identifying significant risks.
- **Incident Response Playbook**: Step-by-step procedures for addressing specific CVEs and incidents.
- **Detection and Analysis**: Methods to detect, analyze, and contain security threats.
- **Recovery and Lessons Learned**: Guidelines for restoring operations and improving future responses.

This document emphasizes continuous improvement, leveraging tools like Tripwire and ManageEngine, and maintaining collaboration with external partners like **CISA** to ensure a robust defense against threats.

## Biggest Takeaways
- **Incident detection** using system logs, packet captures, and file integrity monitoring.
- **Multi-system investigations** with different OS environments (Ubuntu, Debian, Windows).
- **Response strategies** focused on containment, recovery, and continuous improvement.
- **Governance and communication** frameworks for managing complex incidents.

These labs and reports offer a complete view of effective incident response, combining technical investigation with strategic planning.
